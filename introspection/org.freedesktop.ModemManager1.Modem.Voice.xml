      org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Modem.Voice:
      @short_description: The ModemManager Voice interface.

      The Voice interface handles Calls.

      This interface will only be available once the modem is ready to be
      registered in the cellular network. 3GPP devices will require a valid
      unlocked SIM card before any of the features in the interface can be
      used.

    <!--
        ListCalls:
        @result: The list of call object paths.

        Retrieve all Calls.

        This method should only be used once and subsequent information
        retrieved either by listening for the
        #org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Modem.Voice::Added signal,
        or by querying the specific Call object of interest.

    <!--
        DeleteCall:
        @path: The object path of the Call to delete.

        Delete a Call from the list of calls.

        The call will be hangup if it is still active.

        HoldAndAccept:

        Place all active calls on hold, if any, and accept the next
        call.

        Waiting calls have preference over held calls, so the next
        call being active will be any waiting call, or otherwise,
        any held call.

        The user should monitor the state of all available ongoing
        calls to be reported of which one becomes active.

        No error is returned if there are no waiting or held calls.

    <!--
        HangupAndAccept:

        Hangup all active calls, if any, and accept the next call.

        Waiting calls have preference over held calls, so the next
        call being active will be any waiting call, or otherwise,
        any held call.

        The user should monitor the state of all available ongoing
        calls to be reported of which one becomes active.

        No error is returned if there are no waiting or held calls.
